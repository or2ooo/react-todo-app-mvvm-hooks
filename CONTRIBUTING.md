## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

Before creating bug reports, please check the existing issues to determine if someone else has already reported the problem. If the issue doesn't already exist, create a new issue and provide as much information as possible to help maintainers reproduce the problem.

### Suggesting Enhancements

If you have an idea for a new feature or enhancement, first check the existing issues to see if someone else has already suggested it. If not, create a new issue and provide a clear and concise description of the feature or enhancement, along with the reasoning for the proposal.

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Ensure the test suite passes.
4. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Create a pull request with a clear and concise description of your changes.

## Style Guides

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...").
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or fewer.
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line.

### JavaScript Style Guide

All JavaScript code should adhere to the [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).
